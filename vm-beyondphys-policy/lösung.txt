Aufgabe 2:
FIFO Worst Case: Zahlenreihe 0-5. Cache = 6 Löst das problem, die Reihe 0-6 ist aber dann worst case.
LRU Worst case: Auch eine Zahlenreihe 0-5. Jede Page wird gleich genutzt und jede page wird removed bevor sie gecalled wird.
MRU: 0,1,2,3,4,5,4,5,4,5...
Die alten Pages bleiben erhalten und die neuen werden rausgeschmissen, welche aber dann wieder geladen werden.

Um OPT zu erreichen, muss der gesamte Workload in den Cache passen. Wird also durch 50 Pages gelooped wie im Buch, dann muss der Cache 50 Pages halten können.

Aufgabe 3:
[4, 0, 3, 4, 9, 2, 6, 0, 8, 4]
Alle performen ähnlich, da Cache und Workload nicht groß sind.
Aufgabe 4:
Workload:
[1,2,1,2,3,1,2,4,1,2,5,1,2,6]
1-2 sind hot set
3-6 sind distractions
LRU: 8:6
RAND: 8:6
CLOCK

CLOCK: 7:7
Clock mit n Bits (immer das gleiche Ergebnis): 7:7
